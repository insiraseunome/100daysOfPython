"""
üëâ Day 27 Challenge
Welcome to your first video game creation. You will create a video game that creates a character's health 
and attack stats...along with an epic name for your character.

Do not delete today's code. You will be building upon it on Day 28.

Write a subroutine that generates a character: first name and character type (human, imp, wizard, elf, 
etc.).
Write a subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's health 
stats. Use this formula:

(6-sided-roll * 12-sided-roll) / 2 + 10

Write a second subroutine that multiplies a bunch of random dice rolls together to generate the character's 
strength stats. Use this formula:

(6-sided-roll * 12-sided-roll) / 2 + 12

Present the data in a menu with time.sleep and os.system("clear") to make it appealing.
Wrap it in a loop so the user has the option to create another character.
