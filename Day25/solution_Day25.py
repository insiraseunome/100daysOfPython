"""
👉 Day 25 Challenge

Create a subroutine that rolls a dice of any size and returns that number.
Then, create a second subroutine that rolls one six-sided dice and one eight-sided dice.
Multiply the number from the six-sided dice and eight-sided dice together and return that subroutine as a character's health stats for a video game.
Print out the character's health stats.
Add a loop to give the user the option to generate health stats for another character.
(We genuinely see this in video games!)

🥳 Extra points if you ask for the character's name and double extra points if you use different colors!
